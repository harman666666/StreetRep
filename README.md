*~ StreetRep ~*
- StreetRep is a webpage designed for people to post useful information about locations at specific times
- Think yik yak + google maps, users can post their thoughts at a specific location and others can see. 
- Posts can have an assortment of tags which allow filtering (Business, casual, entertainment, humour) 
- Users can reply to posts to allow for social benefits. Potential for businesses to advertise is extremely high. 
- Report posts to prevent trolling and limit posts per user to prevent spam.

<h3>Inspiration</h3>
StreetRep was inspired by the social bulletin application Yik-Yak where users can express their ideas on a location based forum and others can express their appreciation or start up conversations with others. StreetRep takes the socializing aspect of Yik-Yak to a whole new immersive level as users will feel closer to others by viewing the abundance of user activity around them.

<h3>What it does</h3>
StreetRep allows users to express their opinions in the form of text at their current position on the map. Other users can view posts around their area by looking at their respective maps. This way users are aware of how many other are in there area and are up to date with new events and activities. Each post by a user will be able to be voted positively or negatively, which will contribute to the user's reputation. Users with more reputation will gain benefits such as longer post lifespan, and less delays between posts. Users with lower reputation will have opposite effects until they can increase their reputation. This is a preventative measure against bots and malicious users.
